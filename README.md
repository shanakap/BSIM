## Data
The data that support the findings of this study was generated by combining open source and commercial proprietary data. The commercial proprietary data were obtained from the industrial partner to support research purposes and are subject to strict non-disclosure agreements. However, researchers interested in replicating our results on the commercial problems can directly request data from the relevant organisations using the references made in the paper. The data used for synthetic experiments and data created from the open sources for real-world applications are provided under `Data'.<br />

## Usage
###Synthetic experiments
The synthetic experiments are conducted under both Variational Inference (VI) and  Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). VI approach can be executed by running `Synthetic.py` in `Experiments` folder and MCMC method can be executed with the `MCMC_Stan.R` code in `MCMC` folder. 

###Real experiments  
The real experiments are only implemented with VI method since the scalability. This can be executed by running `Real.py` in the `Experiments` folder. Please note that only the data acquired from the open source is given in the `Data` folder and other fields are kept blank.
